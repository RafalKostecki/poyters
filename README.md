# Poyters
[Poyters](https://poyters.pl) is my own brand single page application. I hand-coded it in the newest Angular version and Nest.js. It provides an easy data presentation mechanism and Poyters Account functionalities (sign in/up etc).

## Set up
To set up a whole project (including API) at first, u need to `git clone` Poyters repository and than go to main dir and run `npm install` command to get all API packages. You have to do the same at /client directory to get Poyters client packages. To run both (API and client) need to run `npm start` command at specific directory - main for API and /client for client side of the project.
